Hello, this is my very first game I am making with Godot. In this game, I am also using C# (I've never used it) and I hope to learn more about C# and Godot.

The base game is finished:
- player jumping
- pipes moving 
- multiple pipes
- score detection
- pipe and floor detection


Ease of use update (New additions):
- Game instructions
- Game Over Menu 
- Reset Button
- Quit Button

Game Releses:
    Windows and Linux have their respective folders for the games inside
    
    The Mac version had to be split in half with 7z to upload to GitHub

    to reassemble the file: 
        download 7zip, and both split files
        open your terminal, after installing 7zip, and use the command: 7z x macGame.zip.001
        if done correctly, 7zip will output the fully assembled file
