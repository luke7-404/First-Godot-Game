Hello, this is my very first game I am making with Godot. In this game, I am also using C# (I've never used it) and I hope to learn more about C# and Godot.

The base game is finished:
- player jumping
- pipes moving 
- multiple pipes
- score detection
- pipe and floor detection


Ease of use update (New additions):
- Game instructions
- Game Over Menu 
- Reset Button
- Quit Button
